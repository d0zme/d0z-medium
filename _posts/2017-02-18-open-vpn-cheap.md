One of the traits of a system administrator is to provide to the employees tools that can help them in their jobs. Some tools can be useful and may be costly. Some are available and can be tweaked a bit.

An open VPN is one of them. Nowadays, communications have become the blood flow of corporations and organizations around the world. In order to survive, they need to communicate, adequately, with their internal clients (employees) and external clients (costumers).

The question, though, if I use an open VPN then how do open VPN proxys work? This question can become more complicated if you are a manager who has to evaluate and determine the cost effectiveness of implementing determined IT solutions since, by all apparent means, an open source SSL VPN is free.

## What Is Open VPN?

An Open Virtual Private Network (Open VPN) is a software tool used by organizations. It permits its employees to access the company's network through the internet. The reason they need to use it is because the World Wide Web isn't a secure place. If an organization has its defenses down, it will be a victim of hackers and crackers in no time, affecting its operations.

Since this scenario is the headache of every manager or system administrator, the best thing to do is to provide the people on the road (like salesmen, technicians or executives in trips outside town or outside the country) a tool that it is easy to use, load and doesn't cause any kind of problems.

Although there are pre-configured solutions for establishing a virtual private network, there are several solutions in the internet that are free. Which one should you choose? It depends on your needs.

If you consider that your IT department won't be able to manage the implementation of an open VPN (due to time constraints, lack of personnel or simple lack of knowledge), then a commercial version is your best option. However, if you don't have the money to buy a VPN solution from the market, then an open VPN is the way to go.
