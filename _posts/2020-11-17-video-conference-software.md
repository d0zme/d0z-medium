Confined to our homes, working remotely or in the new normality that leads to coming to the office a few days a week, video conferencing solutions are part of the daily lives of millions of people around the world. This is something we have been talking about for months: teleworking and videoconferencing form a binomial that can hardly be separated.

However, beyond the characteristics that each solution presents to communicate in video (ranging from something as simple as Google Duo, to something as complete as Cisco Webex), today we wanted to ask ourselves about the degree of security they present. To do this, we have selected some of the most popular ones and asked ourselves, for example, how they integrate (if at all) such an important feature as end-to-end encryption (E2EEE).

## Zoom

We've been hearing for months that Zoom has serious security problems. But the truth is that they are not so many, nor are they more than those that other similar companies can present.

In fact, of those we analyze in this article, Zoom may be the most open about what it is doing to improve the security of its solution.

In the last week, the company has announced its new end-to-end encryption system in the form of a beta, both for paid users and those who use its solution for free. In return, once it is enabled, some features that may be of interest, such as cloud recording, streaming and conversation transcription, are lost.

## Signal

If what you need is true end-to-end encryption in a single person conversation, then Signal is probably the best option you have available.

With privacy as a banner, the company has managed to position itself as the reference solution for those who need to encrypt text or audio messages, VoIP calls and now, also video conferences.

On the other hand, at this time Signal does not offer the possibility of making group video calls, and in fact, the only groups we can manage are those based on text messages.

## Wire

Less well known than the rest, Wire is an instant messaging application very similar to WhatsApp, but with a clear business focus. Like WhatsApp, this application offers video conferencing for up to four people and audio calls with a limit of 20 guests.

But at the same time, it also takes elements of Signal, as the end-to-end encryption always remains active and it is impossible to disable that option. It is interesting to note that Wire uses its own encryption protocol, which it has named Proteus, specifically optimized for mobile and multi-device messaging.
FaceTime

If you need to securely connect more than four guests in a video conference, one option to consider is of course FaceTime. The Apple solution supports up to 32 users in a single room, offering E2EEE encryption for all of them.

Of course, this only works if all the users involved have a device of the brand, either iPhone/iPad or Mac. The other problem that it has and that makes it difficult to enter the world of business, is that it does not have some of the most used features in the corporate sector, such as the possibility of screen sharing or sending files.

## Jitsi

Although it is not usually one of the best known video conferencing solutions, it offers several interesting and worthwhile ingredients. First, Jitsi is Open Source software, so it can be adapted to the needs of any company.

This allows companies, for example, to deploy their own Jitsi Videobridge server in their own facilities, or even to run it in a cloud instance. Or if they prefer, they can use the public server that provides the application itself, available for both iOS and Android.

For the moment, end-to-end encryption is reserved for conversations of only two people, although it is likely that in a future update of the App, it will be extended to group conversations.

## Microsoft Teams

Companies that already have a product like Office 365, have in Microsoft Teams their natural ally. It is easy to deploy, does it to scale and offers a large number of business collaboration options.

However, both users and companies must bear in mind that at present the Microsoft solution does not offer E2EE encryption in any of its versions.

And while it is true that it offers other features aimed at improving the security of conversations, or the integration of secure services such as Azure, the truth is that not offering this type of encryption puts Microsoft's solution below its competitors in this field.

## Cisco Webex Meetings

The security that Microsoft Teams does not offer, is present inCisco Webex Meetings, probably the most used video conferencing solution in the business world.

With the capacity to organize group conversations of up to one hundred participants, it is also capable of providing end-to-end encryption for all of them. It should be noted, however, that this type of encryption is not enabled by default, so it will be up to the company's IT administrator to configure this option.

As they explain in their technical documentation, "The Cisco Webex cloud does not decrypt media flows as it does in normal communications. Instead, it establishes a transport layer security (TLS) channel for client-server communication. In addition, all Cisco Webex clients generate key pairs and send the public key to the host client.

This is true for both customers who have a paid account with Cisco and those who are using a free version, which in this case, can request customer service to enable that option.

## Google Meet

Google Meet wants to position itself as the best alternative to Zoom, but it does not stand out precisely because of its commitment to E2EE encryption in the field of security.

In fact, it doesn't offer it in Google Meet or in most of its most popular products, such as Gmail, Google Drive or Google Docs. The only product in which we find this possibility is Google Duo, Google's alternative for FaceTime, and in which it is possible to maintain a secure video conference for up to 12 people.
