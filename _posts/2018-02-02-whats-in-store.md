2018 is expected to be another year that comes with increased concerns for cyber security. It will not be any different from 2017, the year when data breaches were reported in Kmart, Verizon, and Equifax. Cyber security companies will be more concerned with the growing size of attack incidents, even with reducing overall cost. Here is what’s in store for cyber security in 2018:
Enforcement of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

From May 25th, cyber protection companies will have to grapple with the European Union’s new GDPR, when the new rules come into force. The new rules are meant to protect the personal data of all citizens of the EU. It is expected that infringement of the rules will attract hefty fines. That’s why ISO 27001 consultants are busy trying to enable companies to conform to the standards.
Graceful handling of data breaches

Did you know that, as an organization, you have the power to lessen the impact of data breaches by handling it gracefully? You might want to avoid following the Equifax 2017 example. For once, they delayed disclosure, misdirected potential victims, and failed to fix a glaring vulnerability. That’s why any cyber security consultant will advise that you take any data breaches in 2018 more gracefully.
Acting ahead of a ransomware attack

The last few years have seen growth in the threat of ransomware. Given the number of high-profile victims it has claimed so far, not much has been learned from this bludgeoning threat. Cyber security companies are expected to advise their clients to carry out regular backups, system updates & patchwork, and put in place real-time defences. There is no reason why ransomware should continue being such a big issue.
Using AI and machine learning to boost cyber defences

Artificial Intelligence and the closely-related machine learning have been making a huge impact in a number of industries. Any sane cyber security consultant should be thinking of how they can use AI to enhance cyber security. Machine learning can be used to predict and accurately identify possible attacks. No need to fear that the attackers will be the first to exploit AI. Cyber security companies should just get to work.
Shortage of skills

There aren’t many ISO 27001 consultants to help fight the growing cyber security threats. A number of cyber security companies have seen a shortage of qualified professionals, even in the midst of soaring wages. There is expected to be a growth in the need for the services of cyber protection companies.
