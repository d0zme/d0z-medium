Modifying your hosts file allows you to override the domain name system (DNS) for a domain on a specific machine. This process is useful when you want to perform the following tasks:

- Test your site without the test link before publishing it with SSL.
- Verify that an alias site works before DNS changes.
- Working on other DNS-related tasks.

What it also allows for is the blocking of malicious or undesirable domains so you don't have rely on browser plugins.

## How to modify your hosts file

Modifying your hosts file will cause your local machine to look directly at the Internet protocol (IP) address you specify.

Modifying your hosts file requires adding two entries to it. Each entry contains the IP address to which you want the site to resolve and a version of the Internet address. For example, add the following two entry points, www.domain.com and domain.com, to the renewed Rackspace PHP5 (PHP5-ITK) cluster:

64.49.219.194 www.domain.com
64.49.219.194 domain.com

This article provides instructions for locating and editing the hosts file on the following operating systems:

    Microsoft® Windows® 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, and Windows Vista™

    Linux®.
    MacOS® X versions 10.0 to 10.1.5
    MacOS X versions 10.6 to 10.12

After adding the domain information and saving the file, your system starts resolving to the IP address you specified. When you are finished testing, remove these entries.
