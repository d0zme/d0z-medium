Proton, the well-known Wine based compatibility layer developed by Valve that allows running Windows games on Linux and macOS, has had us on tenterhooks since June due to the absence of major releases in the stable branch, but fortunately the streak has been cut recently with version 5.13, which although it doesn't bring revolutionary new features, at least it opens the door to running more games.

Proton 5.13 is based on Wine 5.13 and brings things like improved integration with the Steam client itself; the initiation of support for playing all kinds of video formats to cover games that use older libraries for that purpose; improved support for multi-monitor systems; improvements to audio support in the games Halo 3, Beyond: Two Souls and Tomb Raider 2; includes DXVK 1. 7.2, FAudio 20.10 and the latest version of VKD3D adapted to Proton; also compiled for the next generation of [Steam Linux Runtime](https://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/0/1638675549018366706/).

According to what they publish on [Github](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog), these new titles should be funcitonal on any updated Linux distro:
- Red Dead Redemption 2
- Horizon Zero Dawn
- DEATH STRANDING
- Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes
- Final Fantasy XV
- Sea of Thieves
- Star Wars: Battlefront II (2017)
- Call of Duty: WWII
- Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare
- Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered
- Asssassin's Creed: Rogue
- Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag
- South Park: The Fractured But Whole
- DiRT Rally 2
- Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition
- Age of Empires III
- Dragon Quest Builders 2
- Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation
- Tron 2.0
- AO Tennis 2
- Fight'N Rage
- Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries

The important thing is that the evolution of Proton does not stop to improve the support for the execution of Windows games on Linux. This time we have the inclusion as playable of many AAA games both recent and old, but in the case of the latter even today they continue to maintain their appeal because they belong to very consolidated sagas in the industry or come from the hand (directly or indirectly) of Sony, whose first party games are very well valued by public and critics.

Remember that the use of Proton depends on Vulkan support, so a relatively recent GPU is needed to take full advantage of it. Here the big winner is AMD, as all GCN graphics support Vulkan, although in older models is necessary to put some hand to activate the AMDGPU driver. On the part of NVIDIA, it would be advisable to have a Pascal or later generation graphics.

Obtaining Proton 5.13 is very simple. You only have to open the Steam client, go to Parameters, Steam Play section, check the box "Enable Steam Play for all other titles", select Proton 5.13, click on the OK button and restart the Steam client.
