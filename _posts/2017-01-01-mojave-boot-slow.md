Every update of macOS creates many problems on Mac. Likewise, Mojave also has some issues. One of the important issue is Mojave takes longer to boot. Some people said that Mojave won’t boot/startup. Here I am going to tell you the solutions to fix this issue.

Solution 1: Force Restart

    Press and hold the Power Button until your Mac turned off.
    Wait for few seconds and then press the Power Button to turn on your Mac.

Solution 2: Select your startup disk

    Go to Apple menu->System Preferences.
    Click “Startup Disk” icon.
    Click the lock icon to unlock.
    Enter your Admin Password and then click “Unlock”.
    Select your Startup Disk (Macintosh HD) and then click “Restart”.
    Now your Mac will start up normally.

Solution 3: Disconnect all accessories and devices

    Disconnect all peripheral devices from your Mac like the printer, scanner, mouse, keyboard, webcam, etc.
    Disconnect all accessories like USB, FireWire, Thunderbolt devices, etc.
    Don’t use hubs/extension cords with your Mac when you start your Mac.

Solution 4: Fix disk errors in Recovery Mode

    Turn off your Mac via Apple menu->Shut Down.
    Press the Power Button.
    Press and hold the Command + R keys simultaneously as soon as possible after pressing the Power Button until the Apple Logo appears.
    After that macOS Utilities window will appear with 4 options. Tap “Disk Utility”.
    Tap “Continue”.
    Select the disk/drive (Macintosh HD) that you want to repair.
    Select First Aid->Run. This action will check the disk for errors.

    Then immediately press and hold the Option + Command + P + R keys simultaneously as quickly as possible after pressing the Power Button.
    Keep pressing those keys until you hear the startup sound for the second time.
    Wait for some time. Your Mac may take 15-20 minutes to restart.
    Then your mac will restart normally.

Solution 6: Restart your Mac in Safe Mode

Restarting your Mac in Safe Mode will fix many issues in the Mac. But you can’t use some features in Safe Mode.

    You can see the Apple Logo on the screen. Don’t leave the Shift key when you see the Apple Logo.
