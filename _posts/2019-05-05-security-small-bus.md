When it comes to being responsible for a company’s cyber security, it is the IT department that carries the most weight. For such companies, cyber security becomes a second-tier priority. As cyber security consultants have noted, such businesses rarely set aside a substantive budget for securing their systems.

Of course, some roles played by the IT department, cannot be delegated to someone else. The work of coming up with innovations that provide the rest of the employees with the best apps and interface is best left to them. Cyber protection companies are of the view that the IT guys should play a central part in fostering knowledge sharing and collaboration. However, when it comes to cyber security, everyone in the company should be involved.
Cyber Security In The IT Department

As much as the IT department is responsible for ensuring the company’s cyber security procedures and policies are followed, they might not be held accountable for every incident or breach. It is the view of cyber security companies that every employee is responsible for the company’s cyber security. If anything, employees pose the highest risk to cyber security, given the type of activities they engage in. it is not, therefore, good when companies heavily rely on the IT department. Instead, they should equip employees with the resources and knowledge to be responsible for cyber security.

It is not the view of ISO 27001 consultants that you do away with cyber security tool. By all means use firewalls, machine learning mechanisms, and anti-virus software. But know that over 65 percent of threats and from those within the organization. That’s why everyone should know they have a part to play in ensuring information security.

As such, HR needs to work with cyber security companies to train the employees on their role in cyber security. Even so, developers should factor security features into new products, apps, and technology. It is the role of the chief officers to ensure appropriate protocols, reporting practices, and policies are put in place. By working closely with HR, they will ensure that the employees are made aware of the stringent protocols and policies. Employees need to be made aware of their access rights even as they are taught how to use the available security tools.
