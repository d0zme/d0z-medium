0 A.D., is a game inspired by **Age of Empires II** that has the advantage of being free and open-source. It's been contstantly in development for nearly a decade by a worldwide group of volunteers, and it's at the point of being competitive with the Age of Empires franchise.

It should be noted, in turn, that '0 A.D.' started at the beginning of the 21st century as a mod of 'Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings', although its creators took the wise decision to set it up on their own, with much greater creative freedom. One thing is certain: anyone who has the Ensemble Studios saga on a pedestal will feel at home in '0 A.D.'.

Taking a glance at [its source code](https://github.com/0ad/0ad), you will see that it's written mostly in C++ and builds easily on Linux or FreeBSD. Package managers for several Linux distros also have this game included, making it much more Linux-friendly than other strategy games.

## Overview of 0 A.D.

The first thing that catches the eye of '0 A.D.' is how careful the whole product is. And even more so if we take into account that it is an alpha, a version far from being finished.

It is true that it has some sections that are not accessible at the moment, such as the Campaign, where Wildfire Games promises historical and legendary missions to revive in this RTS, but that is a sin to know that, at the beginning, we have twelve civilizations. 12!

What's more, each one has differences, both at an architectural level in their constructions and in unique units. The Maurians are fond of pachyderms, and when we start a game with them, we see that they use one of their elephants as a "pack mule". It is quite striking.

The civilizations, for which it interests to him to know it, are:
- Athenians: cradle of Western civilization and birthplace of democracy
- Britons: Celtic tribes of the British Isles
- Carthaginians: a formidable force in the western Mediterranean
- Spartans: a decisive military power around 650 B.C.
- Gauls: Celtic tribes from continental Europe
- Macedonians: ancient Greek kingdom located in the northeast of the Greek peninsula
- Maurians: one of the largest and most populated empires in antiquity
- Persians: pioneers in empire building in the ancient world
- Ptolemies: the last dynasty of ancient Egypt
- Romans: another of the greatest empires of the ancient world
- Sele√∫cidas: the Greek-Macedonian dynasty
- Iberians: a people of mysterious origins and language

In spite of the inevitable differences between each civilization, as it happened with other deliveries of 'Age of Empires', the changes do not become so evident until we move to the second age, when in most cases unique units and constructions are unblocked.

## 0 A.D., a strategy game with the spirit of the 90s

Wildfire Games is putting a lot of effort into '0 A.D.' and it is commendable that it has taken care of such vital aspects as its soundtrack, and that we speak, we insist, of an alpha. Graphically, it can't compete with the greats of the genre, but it's obvious: their team is more limited and no matter how much enthusiasm they put into it, they're not Blizzard with the 'StarCraft' saga.

We are also talking, in any case, about a game with a 3D engine that allows us to zoom in or out and rotate it at will, something that can't be said of the classic 'Age of Empires II' (which doesn't need it either). But that's the least of it when we get with the mouse.

The mouse and the keyboard, rather. Because an RTS is played ega so. All the basic commands of the Ensemble Studios saga are maintained: create queue constructions, give patrol orders, protect targets, garrison, alternate between formations and so on. It can be said that AI is a problem in certain situations, such as the villagers blocking when there is a lot of movement in small spaces, but it is, without a doubt, a more than worthy job.

In addition, I liked the proposal of '0 A.D.' by limiting the construction space to the land provided by the main building. You can't increase the radius like in 'The Settlers', but we do have other ways to increase our land by creating more bases or by means of special buildings of some civilizations. That or capture certain buildings from rivals. Because not only can we destroy them, but there's also the possibility that they're ours.

This change of mentality that prevents us from standing in front of the enemy's base to build military posts or watchtowers, there is also the fact that between each tower there must be a separation of about 60 meters. This will not please, of course, those who bet on a turtle style in strategy games. But it does encourage more intense battles.

On the other hand, it is remarkable that not only the villagers can construct buildings. In fact, the villagers will not be able to construct all types of buildings, but will be curiously several of the most basic soldiers. However, a construction can be started by one soldier and finished by ten villagers at once. Some things never change. But it does clash a bit at first.

0 A.D.' is also very flexible and its control is very comfortable, especially when we apply the relevant improvements for each age. For example, when creating production queues for five units at once. Or to let us know how many resources we are missing to have something, instead of just showing how much the total should be. And it's also an extra incentive that units can gain seniority, so those that survive and defeat more enemies will end up being more powerful. The trick here is to bring out healers and protect them.

In short, any Age of Empires fan will feel at home, and this is the best compliment you can give. Either that, or your Alpha 19 eats other RTS's that were supposedly put on sale when they were finished, and it's free, damn it!
