"The cloud" is a resource full of advantages for large & small enterprises alike, that's why it's being used almost everywhere in IT. Although, when you are shopping around for providers, you are met with a variety of cloud services. In particular, [managed cloud hosting](https://www.temok.com/managed-digitalocean-hosting) is a type of shared hosting for your websites or web apps. In this type of hosting a website is hosted on several servers that are connected to each other like a bunch of grapes in the same vine. This cluster of servers is called a cloud.

Normally websites start on a shared hosting, as it is just enough to start on the internet. When a web project is started, there are almost always few users and the website does not consume many server resources, so shared hosting fulfills all the necessary requirements to start a project on the web.

But sometimes, the web project or website hosted on a shared hosting, becomes famous and begins to become overwhelmed with visitors. Each visitor's session interacts with the website, either by starting logins, subscribing, or registering to make comments, etc. That kind of interaction with the website, takes processor and memory resources from the shared hosting server.

When a website is using a lot of resources, the shared hosting starts denying service to that website and the website will no longer be displayed and an error message of "not found", "503 error" or simply load forever without displaying your website will appear. This is a common problem in shared hosting that has pages with a lot of traffic. This is normal and it is expected that shared hosting behaves like this, because if it does not, other users' websites hosted on the same server will stop working, which is not fair, since other users have also paid for a part of that same shared server.

## Advantages of Cloud Hosting:

### Speed

In a cloud hosting the website is hosted on several servers connected to each other as if they were a cluster. Each connected server can be in a different country or continent. The cloud hosting will use the server closest to the user who requests your website. This way your website will be displayed up to twice as fast as on a shared hosting. And if you use SSD cloud hosting you will notice an increase in the speed of loading your additional page.

### Continuity

When a website is taking a lot of resources from a server, before your website shows an error to your visitor, the cloud hosting takes another server from the cluster (cloud-cloud) and shows your website. Your website will always be shown as active and you will save yourself the errors of resource abuse from a shared hosting.

### Security

In the cloud hosting, hackers will be able to attack a server to harm your website, but it will be very difficult for them to enter all the servers in the cloud. This way your information is more secure.

### Scalability

If your website starts to need more processor and RAM resources, cloud hosting can easily and quickly increase processor cores and RAM (Random Access Memory). Of course there will be an additional cost, but it will be much less than the cost of migrating to another server. In cloud hosting you can easily upgrade with one click.

## Conclusion

Cloud hosting is a good option before migrating to a VPS that can sound expensive for projects that are just beginning to succeed. We recommend this cloud hosting. It is used by schools, hospitals, universities and municipalities without any problems. It's a cloud hosting that holds up! Proven!
