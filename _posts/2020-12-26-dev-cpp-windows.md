Remembering back to tyhe early 2000's, there was only a handful of alternatives to Visual Studio to build C++ programs. One of them being Dev C++ by bloodshed.net, a simple and free IDE that could run on even a Pentium I with 32 MB of ram. You could even install external C libraries automatically as DevPaks.

Dev C++ was outshined by Code::Blocks in the world of free Visual Basic alternatives, but I could never see the appeal to the bloated platform.

The good news is that **Dev-C++** has been forked and republished by [Embarcadero.com](https://blogs.embarcadero.com/dev-c-is-a-low-memory-windows-native-c-ide-built-in-delphi/), which is now optimized to natively run on Windows 10.

Code written will be compiled to native code and use VCL for UI (uses WinAPI). In theory, it can produce small executables, with minimal dependencies.
