VPN set up with satellite Internet have been all tried and executed. But then again, these two technologies are not entirely at harmony with each other. Initially,

VPN technology implementation requires secure data transmission lines for it to protect the important information that would be passing through. But now, still thanks to advance technology, a VPN connection was seen to work with Satellite Internet Connections. Then again, limitations still apply.

## What is a VPN?

VPN stands for virtual private network. It is a very cost-effective and a rather secure way used by companies to connect to other systems and networks over the Internet. It has been a popular way to provide users, or employees for that matter, access to the said the network wherever they are, using a regular web connection. It is much preferable for companies to setup rather than to create an totally private network of their own, because VPN is way cheaper, easier to use, and has lower maintenance requirements.

## What is a Satellite Internet Service?

Satellite Internet services, on the other hand, is a type of Internet service that uses satellite technology to provide two-way data communication facilities, one for uploading and another for downloading. It is usually used in the rural areas where both the DSL and cable Internet lines cannot reach. Consequently, users have to setup up a satellite dish and connect it to a special modem. That way, they start to enjoy an Internet access that faster than dial-up modem, but a little slower than DSL.

## Can Satellite Internet Services Support VPN?

The simple answer would be yes. VPN with satellite Internet is possible, but there are certain platforms that have to be used. Some satellite Internet service provider recommends the use of Galileo, a program that stabilizes the use of satellite Internet VPN, VOIP, and similar applications. Other than Galileo, HughesNet is also used. Cisco client VPN over satellite Internet connection is also a popular hardware that is being utilized nowadays, although it doesn't come cheap.

The use of these and other third-party software, program, and hardware are necessary before a VPN over satellite Internet connection is initiated. This is because the principles behind these technologies are somewhat different. In reality, the two are not really intended to work together.

Generally, a VPN entails the use of a low-latency, high-bandwidth network so that the connection will work properly. Now in the case of satellite Internet service, the usual connection has high-latency. This is because satellite Internet service signals has to travel long distances before data is transferred. This is the very problem experienced by VPN over Wildblue satellite users experience.

Satellite Internet service also has low bandwidth, as far as upstream data is concerned. Generally, the upstream or upload bandwidth that a satellite service provides to its Internet users is somehow similar to that of a dial-up connection. A VPN connection needs high-speed data transfer, both for uploads and downloads to secure optimum data protection.

Additionally, Satellite Internet services also uses the IP spoofing technique so as to boost its connection performance. This technique is part of the service of most satellite Internet providers. IP spoofing, no matter how good it works to improve the performance of the satellite Internet network, is actually detrimental to that of a VPN. So as a work around, the VPN software that both the server and the client use have to support IP spoofing. It means that the VPN software should have a program integrated in it that could bypass the IP spoofing program in most satellite Internet service providers. All these makes VPN set up with satellite Internet very difficult.

Because of the inherent incompatibility of VPN connections and satellite Internet services, there are much more cons than there are pros about the connection.

## Pros

- The VPN connection becomes portable.
- Because there are satellite systems can be installed in trucks and mobile homes, creating a VPN connection becomes very handy. There is no need to setup both Internet and VPN connection every time you have to move, travel, or change location, provided that you have all the software installed and the connection working.
- Total network control.
- With satellite connection, your VPN connection doesn't need to pass through third party provider like your local telephone company or that of the cable companies. There's only your satellite dish and your main Internet provider's server to think about.


## Cons

- Poor overall performance.
- If you are using VPN with satellite Internet, you will experience very poor performance quality. The speed of data transfer is notably similar to a dial-up connection. And if you intend to download enormous files from the corporate server, it could take hours before it completes. You might think you should be enjoying satellite broadband VPN speeds, but unfortunately, you are connecting a littler higher that 56kpbs only.
- Minimal technical support provided.
- Big corporation creates VPN out of their own requirements and specifications. This makes a VPN connection very hard to troubleshoot. And because a satellite Internet service can't really guarantee workability between VPN software used and their network, less or no technical support is provided. This is mostly due to the lack of expertise and knowledge about the company's individual network.
- The use of Internet connection sharing software could be a problem.
- This is true not only with satellite Internet VPN, but with other connections as well. Sometimes, the need to install Internet connection software is a requirement before a satellite connection run. Then again, Cable and DSL provider rarely need this software. So the problem seems to only exist in satellite Internet connection services.

While VPN set up with satellite Internet is possible, it is really not feasible. VPN technology implementation requires a connection a lot similar to cable and DSL in terms of latency and bandwidth. But for those people who don't have much option in terms Internet service providers, using the two together should be worth it. Only, it requires professional setup and expert maintenance.
