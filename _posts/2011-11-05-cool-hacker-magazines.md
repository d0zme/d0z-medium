In my ongoing effort to learn more and stay informed about everything in the security industry, I have come across a few security focused magazines to assist me with that ideal. Over the past few months I have subscribed to some magazines, both physical and online versions, and felt I’d share. I’ve gone ahead and itemized the list below with reference to cost, delivery method, etc. I have only listed the magazines that I personally look at and recommend. There are a bunch of other magazines out there, but if you know of other security magazines that you like and think I should look at, please let me know and post the info in the comments below.

## 2600 – The Hacker Quarterly

2600 - The Hacker QuarterlyThis one is my favorite. It is geared more toward the blackhat side of security and is well known for providing how-to’s and example of exploits.

- Annual cost of $24 US for print version (multiple year and lifetime subscriptions available for discounted prices)
- Distributed quarterly…

As my second favorite, Hakin9 shows both high level and more advanced subjects which include everything from basic computer security to advanced mobile security, and interviews with big names in the industry.

- Digital version available
- Issues prior to May 2011 are free
- Future editions will recur at $18.45 per month

## SC Magazine

SC Magazine is a good baseline for security related material. It covers mostly higher level topics and would be best geared as a general info type of read.
