The site is down now, but I got yet another phishing email using Google redirection to hide the real address that the user is being forwarded to. Sorry for the super long line (had to break it up): http://www.google.com/... (redacted)

Google has been notoriously bad about fixing these issues, even after admitting a few times that it was an issue. As a matter of fact I don’t know of a single example of where they really have fixed these issues at all, other than blocking a single URL. Not a great track record. The reason being it’s far too difficult to fix them than to leave them there, even if it hurts their consumers, and their own brand in the process. Anything for a buck, I guess.
