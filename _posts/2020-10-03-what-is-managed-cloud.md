If you're reading this blog, you probably already have an idea what hosting or web hosting is. [Managed cloud hosting](https://www.temok.com/managed-amazon-cloud-hosting) is an entirely different beast to comprehend.

## A Clear Description of Cloud Hosting

One of the most popular trends in the web hosting industry today is cloud or cloud hosting. Simply put, a "cloud" in this context is a group of computers that are connected to each other via a network and work together to provide hosting services.

This means that the different services of a single hosted website can be drawn from the computing power of a network of more than one server in the cloud. In fact, the cloud can be thought of as a cloud server composed of the computing power of several servers in a network.

This would be opposed to the idea of having one dedicated server (or a virtual private server), in which you want everything hosted at a static location.

When you have **“managed cloud hosting”**, you are renting out distributed computing resources from a provider, and they are in charge of uptime & security. Billing arrangements are made monthly, as opposed to renting out hourly slices, and the management part is left in your hands.

## Advantages of Cloud Hosting

Cloud computing or cloud computing is a radical change from more traditional hosting options such as shared and dedicated hosting options. It also has some advantages that set it apart from these other hosting choices. On the one hand, site owners tend to get what they pay for with cloud hosting. 

This method of payment is sometimes called "pay as you go". If a company uses only 200 Gigabytes of storage with a cloud package, that company will only pay for that 200 GB. With more traditional hosting options, that same company would probably have to pay for more space than that, regardless of whether the extra space was used or not.

Cloud hosting also offers site owners scalability. The traffic of many websites can suddenly increase rapidly. If a site suddenly needs more space or bandwidth, cloud hosting allows that site to grow naturally using more resources in the cloud. In comparison, performing such an expansion with traditional web hosting methods can be a very expensive and laborious process.

## Disadvantages of Cloud Hosting

Unfortunately, there are some disadvantages to cloud hosting that website owners should take into account. Probably the most important of these is the fact that cloud hosting involves certain security risks that do not affect websites that use shared hosting or dedicated servers.

This is due to the fact that information is not stored locally on a server in one place. Instead, this information may be transmitted regularly between multiple servers. This movement of data can make your data vulnerable to hackers. Cloud hosting companies can use security and encryption methods to negate the possibility of this information being compromised, but the risk remains.

## Wrapping Up

If you choose to go with cloud hosting, there are three things you should consider when looking for the best cloud hosting provider. First of all, you should consider whether what you are being charged for the scalability option of the package is actually a good deal.

You should only pay for what you expect your website to consume, both during peak and off-peak hours. If you end up being billed more than you would be with a shared or dedicated hosting plan, you should look for a more cost-effective host.

Secondly, you should look for quality web tools. Although scalability is important, if you are unable to do anything with your account, it will always be a waste of money. Things to check are control panels with multiple options, site creation tools, and e-commerce modules.

Finally, make sure you take a cloud hosting package that comes with quality technical support. Although cloud hosting has many advantages, you may face technical difficulties, as with any other type of hosting plan. Make sure you are able to communicate with technical support 24 hours a day to ensure that your site can avoid significant downtime.
