If you're reading this blog, you probably already have an idea what hosting or web hosting is. [Managed cloud hosting](https://www.temok.com/managed-amazon-cloud-hosting) is an entirely different beast to comprehend.

## Let's remember the basic concepts: hosting and cloud

Let's start at the beginning by remembering what hosting is: a service offered to website owners so that they can store all kinds of files (such as images or videos) over the Internet.

That is, we pay a hosting provider (such as SiteGround) to host our website. Until very recently, hosting was hosted on physical servers, and still is, but new technologies have taken a step forward with the emergence of "the cloud", what we know as cloud.

"The cloud" is still a storage space, but in this case virtual. With cloud computing, or cloud storage, we no longer need an extension of our hard drive, as was the case before. Cloud computing allows us to store our files on virtual servers without having to rely on a physical location.

And we can use applications, programs and other tools from any computer. This new technology is a true digital revolution for many companies, which are migrating their files to the cloud, reducing costs by not having to occupy a certain physical space.

## Cloud Hosting

Cloud hosting refers to servers based on cloud computing technology. In simple words, it is the hosting of websites on virtual servers, so you no longer have to depend on a computer or a physical server. 

The good news is that the user, or customer, only has to pay for what they actually use because there is no need to invest in hardware.

The memory, storage and processing resources work differently than a traditional hosting with cloud hosting. With this new technology your space on the Internet does not depend on a server, but on a network of "nodes", that is, servers connected to "the cloud".

## Is a cloud server the same as a Virtual Private Server?

No, although it can be confusing. VPS servers correspond to pre-Cloud or "cloud" technology.  A Virtual Private Server (VPS) is used when a shared server has become too small for us, for example because of the large number of visits we receive.

Unlike the shared server, the VPS server assigns resources exclusively to one user or company, apart from the rest of the installations on the server. By not sharing resources, we will not be affected in the performance if there is any problem.

The problem with a VPS server is that it can give hardware failures, among others, while the cloud hosting or cloud server is independent of the hardware and if there was any failure the user could always migrate his data to another node.

Cloud hosting uses a large number of servers which are distributed among various data centers located in different places. Another disadvantage of the VPS server is that technical knowledge is required, which is not the case with a shared server.

## Advantages of cloud hosting

### Saving money

The best thing about a cloud server is the tremendous savings it provides, since we only pay for what we use and we will be aware of that when we see the bottom line. On the other hand, if we opt for a traditional hosting we will have to pay a fixed amount, whether we use all the resources or not.

We also avoid purchasing devices and infrastructure with the aim of acquiring resources that we do not consume in the end. Another aspect not less important is that we save costs in electricity consumption or personnel hiring.

### More availability

Cloud servers offer the ability to access the number of servers we need quickly and efficiently.  We can, for example, expand storage capacity automatically, without having to change plans or be obliged to consult with the technical support of a hosting service.

### Flexibility or scalability of resources

We do not need to make new equipment acquisitions, for example. We can increase or decrease the resources we need at any given time and there is no need for unnecessary waiting. Since we pay only for what we use, we save on costs.

### Easy to use control panel

Most cloud hosting service providers offer easy-to-use management or control panels. We can schedule backups with a single click, when the service company is not taking care of maintenance and updates. The management of our panel, in any case, is very simple and similar to that of a traditional hosting, such as cPanel.

### More stability

Since we do not have to fear hardware failures by not depending on a physical server, we have greater availability, a fundamental aspect for many companies. This guarantees us a constant online presence, which we call uptime.

The traditional hosting services offer an average of 99% because there are necessary interruptions of the server, such as maintenance work or updating a hard disk, but with a cloud hosting we will have an uptime of 99.9%. This advantage is due to the fact that the operating system automatically creates a replica of the failed server.
