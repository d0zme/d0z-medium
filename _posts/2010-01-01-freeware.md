    - Preme (Windows 7) - Adds a lot of neat shortcuts and handy features for application windows to Windows 7.
    - Microsoft TechNet's SysInternals Suite (Windows) - A *lot* of useful programs for your PC and networking. Contains great apps like Process Explorer, Autoruns, TCPView, RootkitRevealer, and more.
    - NirSoft (Windows) - Another great suite of system, network, password recovery tools, and more.
    - Sumatra / Foxit (Linux/Windows/Mac) - Great, lightweight alternative PDF readers.
