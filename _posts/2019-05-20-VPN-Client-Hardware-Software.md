VPN client software is for small branch offices and home users. Many VPN clients are available in the market. These depend on the configuration of the machine and the protocol they are using.

VPN client's software is already a part of many operating systems or can be availed as a service pack. Enabling the capability of the protocols in the network connections to use the authentication and encryption provided by VPN is all you need to do. The Point to Point Protocol (PPP) authentication is used for PPTP and L2TP. MPPE- (Microsoft Point to Point Encryption) is used as encryption for PPTP and IPSec is used for L2TP. Usually the clients are remote access VPN's. High dial density and integration with RADIUS- (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is provided by some software's. Some software clients provided by other vendors are

- Safenet Software VPN client
- EAC (Extranet Access Client) for Contivity
- Cisco VPN software clients are for Linux, Win 95/98/98SE/NT/2K/ME/XP.
- VPN-1 SecureClient from Checkpoint
- Aurorean Client from Enterasys
- MovianVPN - Software

Software for Macintosh systems is Netlock and for OS/2 systems basic firewall products are used these are InJoy.
VPN hardware
VPN hardware is dependent on the place of connection and setup. Cheap VPN hardware is available for the client end. POP-(Point-of-Presence) is for high scalability, performance and integration and is costly usually well over $200,000. Multi- port routers usually have custom ASIC- (Application Specific integrated circuits) and technology to handle enterprise business needs. These ASIC's can handle massive client loads, redundancy and load balancing. Integrated into some of this equipment are higher security standards (3DES) and additional networking protocols. Cisco VPN concentrator is a good example. And you may ask what is a VPN concentrator? Cisco VPN hardware is essentially for WAN based companies that require a large number of multiple connections. The VPN concentrator does the job of a router and a firewall for all the multiple connections to the Intranet or internet.

CPE-(Customer Premise Equipment) necessarily has to be compatible with POP equipment and software. These are more diverse like internet appliance, VPN enhanced routers and specialized gateways. Some CPE's are also complicated and can be used as POP equipment. Cisco, 3Com, Symantec, LinkSys and other vendors offer devices that combine Firewall, Network address Translation and VPN functionality. Many of the hardware are supported with web browser interface software that is easy to use and configure in a VPN hardware client.

The promises of VPNs are a business opportunity for ISPs. They are providing a variety of VPN services for remote access clients. These ISP's basically provide you a connection that gives you varied throughput. Several companies are providing facilities to setup and manage VPN connections. VPN is becoming a specialized service and Enterprises have options that were not earlier available to them.
